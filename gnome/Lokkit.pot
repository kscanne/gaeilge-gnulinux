"Firewall Configuration\n"
"\n"
"   Red Hat Linux also offers you firewall protection\n"
"   for enhanced system security. A firewall sits\n"
"   between your computer and the network, and\n"
"   determines which resources on your computer remote\n"
"   users on the network are able to access. A\n"
"   properly configured firewall can greatly increase\n"
"   the out-of-the-box security of your system.\n"
"\n"
"   Choose the appropriate security level for your\n"
"   system.\n"
"\n"
"   High Security -- By choosing High Security, your\n"
"   system will not accept connections that are not\n"
"   explicitly defined by you. By default, only the\n"
"   following connections are allowed:\n"
"\n"
"     * DNS replies\n"
"     * DHCP -- so any network interfaces that use\n"
"       DHCP can be properly configured.\n"
"\n"
"   Using this High Security will not allow the\n"
"   following:\n"
"\n"
"     * Active mode FTP (Passive mode FTP, used by\n"
"       default in most clients, should work fine.)\n"
"     * IRC DCC file transfers\n"
"     * RealAudio(tm)\n"
"     * Remote X Window System clients\n"
"\n"
"   If you are connecting your system to the Internet,\n"
"   but do not plan to run a server, this is the\n"
"   safest choice. If additional services are needed,\n"
"   you can choose Customize to allow specific\n"
"   services through the firewall.\n"
"\n"
"   Medium Security -- Choosing Medium Security will\n"
"   not allow your system to have access to certain\n"
"   resources. By default, access to the following\n"
"   resources are not allowed:\n"
"\n"
"     * ports lower than 1023 -- these are the\n"
"       standard reserved ports, used by most system\n"
"       services, such as FTP, SSH, telnet, and HTTP.\n"
"     * NFS server port (2049)\n"
"     * the local X Window System display for remote X\n"
"       clients\n"
"     * the X Font server port (This is disabled by\n"
"       default in the font server.)\n"
"\n"
"   If you want to allow resources such as\n"
"   RealAudio(tm), while still blocking access to\n"
"   normal system services, choose Medium Security.\n"
"   You can choose Customize to allow specific\n"
"   services through the firewall.\n"
"\n"
"   No Firewall -- No firewall allows complete access\n"
"   and does no security checking. It is recommended\n"
"   that this only be selected if you are running on a\n"
"   trusted network (not the Internet), or if you plan\n"
"   to do more detailed firewall configuration later.\n"
"\n"
"   Choose Customize to add trusted devices or to\n"
"   allow additional incoming interfaces.\n"
msgstr ""

"\n"
"Firewall Customization\n"
"\n"
"   Choose which trusted devices and incoming services\n"
"   should be allowed for your network security\n"
"   settings.\n"
"\n"
"   Trusted Devices -- Checking these for any of your\n"
"   devices allows all traffic coming from that device\n"
"   to be allowed. For example, if you are running a\n"
"   local network, but are connecting to the Internet\n"
"   via a PPP dialup, you could check that eth0 is\n"
"   trusted to allow any traffic coming from your\n"
"   local network.\n"
"\n"
"   It is not recommended to enable this for devices\n"
"   that are connected to public networks, such as the\n"
"   Internet.\n"
"\n"
"   Allow Incoming -- Enabling these options allow the\n"
"   specified services to pass through the firewall.\n"
"   Note, during a workstation-class installation, the\n"
"   majority of these services are not present on the\n"
"   system.\n"
"\n"
"     * DHCP -- This allows DHCP queries and replies,\n"
"       and allows any network interfaces that use\n"
"       DHCP to determine their IP address. DHCP is\n"
"       normally enabled.\n"
"     * SSH -- Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for\n"
"       logging into and executing commands on remote\n"
"       machines. It provides secure encrypted\n"
"       communications. If you plan on accessing your\n"
"       machine remotely via SSH over a firewalled\n"
"       interface, enable this option. You need the\n"
"       openssh-server package installed for this\n"
"       option to be useful.\n"
"     * Telnet -- Telnet is a protocol for logging\n"
"       into remote machines. It is unencrypted, and\n"
"       provides little security from network snooping\n"
"       attacks. Enabling telnet is not recommended.\n"
"       You need the telnet-server package installed\n"
"       for this option to be useful.\n"
"     * WWW (HTTP) -- HTTP is the protocol used by\n"
"       Apache to serve Web pages. If you plan on\n"
"       making your Web server publicly available,\n"
"       enable this option. This option is not\n"
"       required for viewing pages locally or\n"
"       developing Web pages. You need the Apache\n"
"       package installed for this option to be\n"
"       useful.\n"
"     * Mail (SMTP) -- This allows incoming SMTP mail\n"
"       delivery. If you need to allow remote hosts to\n"
"       connect directly to your machine to deliver\n"
"       mail, enable this option. You do not need to\n"
"       enable this if you collect your mail from your\n"
"       ISP's server by POP3 or IMAP, or if you use a\n"
"       tool such as fetchmail. Note that an\n"
"       improperly configured SMTP server can allow\n"
"       remote machines to use your server to send\n"
"       spam.\n"
"     * FTP -- FTP is a protocol used for remote file\n"
"       transfer. If you plan on making your FTP\n"
"       server publicly available, enable this option.\n"
"       You need the wu-ftpd (and possibly anonftp)\n"
"       packages installed for this option to be\n"
"       useful.\n"
"     * Other ports -- You can specify that other\n"
"       ports not listed here be allowed through the\n"
"       firewall. The format to use is\n"
"       'port:protocol'. For example, if you wanted to\n"
"       allow IMAP access through your firewall, you\n"
"       can specify 'imap:tcp'. You can also specify\n"
"       numeric ports explicitly; to allow UDP packets\n"
"       on port 1234 through, specify '1234:udp'. To\n"
"       specify multiple ports, separate them by\n"
"       commas.\n"
